# lrucache
A LEAST RECENTLY USED CACHE
It is a real life data structures application.
We combine doubly linked list and hashmap to produce an efficient data structure called lru cache.
If the cache is full,the last time is thrown out of cache.
If we request for something which is present in the cache,it comes at the top.
